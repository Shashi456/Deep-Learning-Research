# Research

Just a list of papers i read everyday and notes to keep a track of them. I used to read a variety of papers pre 2023 and you can look at them in the [Pre-2023 section](#pre-2023).


# 2nd September 2023

 


## <a id="pre-2023"></a>Pre 2023
# Papers
These will either be paper implementations or/and reviews of various papers and notes for conference sessions, I will read/watch over time. I currently research on Abstractive Summarization ( A task within NLP)
